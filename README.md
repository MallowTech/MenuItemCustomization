# MenuItemCustomization
Sample code to customize Android Menu item in Android

We can extend menu item beyond icon or text using actionLayout attribute in menu.xml. In this layout, we can provide any types of widgets (button, textview,etc..) as per your requirement. Also we can set custom font type and color filter dynamically as you need.
